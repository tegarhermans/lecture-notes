## random walk 1d
+ The simplest illustration is 1d random walk using integer ([Houston-Edwaards et al., 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stgYW6M5o4k&t=63s))
+ The probability to be at position with odd and even values after $N$ steps can be tabulated and formulated ([Weisstein, 2022](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomWalk1-Dimensional.html)).
+ It has several application such as the monkey at the cliff, the gambler's ruin, counting paths, and some mixed problems ([Alm, 2002](http://www2.math.uu.se/~sea/kurser/stokprocmn1/slumpvandring_eng.pdf)).
