## abm
+ Agent based modeling (ABM) is a bottom-up simulation technique where we analyze a system by its individual agents that interact with each other ([Karami, 2021](https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-agent-based-modeling-3eea6a070b72)).
+ The benefits of ABM over other modeling techniques can be captured in three statements: (i) ABM captures emergent phenomena; (ii) ABM provides a natural description of a system; and (iii) ABM is flexible ([Bonabeau, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.082080899))


## sd
+ System Dynamics uses a graphical description to structure complex systems of
differential equations and algebraic equations ([Gustafsson, 2017](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1095658/FULLTEXT01.pdf)).
+ The System Dynamics is a modeling tool that allows to represent and to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems, presenting the linear and nonlinear relations between the variables ([Ebert et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1109/UPEC.2017.8231899)).
